# Products-Deep-Learning
Deep Learning Project w/ TensorFlow

> To get a folder with an EXECUTABLE:  
https://www.dropbox.com/s/0g5tad0of9ta31r/Executable.zip?dl=0  
No Python nor libraries needed for executable.

ModelCreation preferably done on google colab with TPU enabled for best runtime.  
-Requires uncommenting TPU code

Otherwise would optimally require an Nvidia graphics card with cudart installed.  
-Requires uncommenting GPU code.

Libraries needed to run without exe:  
1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow Nightly
4. Tensorflow Text Nightly

Libraries Used in Project:  
1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Tensorflow Hub
4. Tensorflow Text
5. tf-models-official.nlp (optimization)
6. Json
7. re
9. random
10. time
